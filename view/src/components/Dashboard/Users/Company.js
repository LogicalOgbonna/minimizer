                A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is
                a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected
                graph that connects all the vertices together, without any
                cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. MST
                problem is of high importance in network optimization, but it is
                also difficult for the traditional network optimization
                technique to deal with. A good example would be a road
                construction company charged to construct streets to connect
                houses in a particular city, constructing the roads (vertices)
                requires a graph containing the houses (nodes) to be connected
                by the road. Some of the roads might be too expensive, either
                because they are longer, or the topography of the land (a valley
                or mountain), these roads would be represented with larger
                weight. Having in mind the cost of constructing these roads,
                larger weights on roads implies higher costs, a spanning tree
                for this graph would be as subset of those roads that has no
                cycles but still connects every house; there might be several
                spanning trees possible. A minimum spanning tree would be one
                with the lowest total cost, representing the least expensive
                path for constructing the road.

                This is exactly what this project is set to achieve, by
                developing a fast and reliable computer program that could
                compute at a great level a cost-effective MTS of any undirected
                graph network supplied by a user.
